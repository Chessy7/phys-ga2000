Computer is a crucial tool for research. From this course, I want to have a glance of its general applications in research and gain resources which I could learn things in more details when I need to use them later. I have done some simulation in matlab before and some simple projects with python. I just started my PhD program, so I'm not sure what I'll do after it. For my PhD, I'm looking for an interesting project in soft matter field.
